# terratest
terratest is a simple unittesting library for use in the [terra programming language](https://github.com/terralang/terra). It allows you to write tests for both lua and terra code at three different level of scope: (1) inline testing; (2) the `testenv` environment, which provides a safe scope for testing; and (3) a `testset` environement, which is a safe environment within a `testenv`. Safe here means that statements in one environment do not affect statements in other environments. Test statistics are printed when testing is performed within the `testenv` environment. If a test fails, the linenumber and filename are printed for convenience. Here follow some examples
